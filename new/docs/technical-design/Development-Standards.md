# Development Standards

This document establishes the coding conventions, architecture rules, and testing standards for the Hospital Management System.

## 1. Modular Monolith Strictness
We have embraced a **Modular Monolith** architecture using Nx and NestJS. 
While all modules exist in a single repository and run in a single process, they must remain logically isolated.
- **Bounded Contexts**: Never perform database joins across bounded contexts (e.g., joining an `Order` table to a `Patient` table). Treat each module as if it were a distinct microservice.
- **Inter-Module Communication**: If a module requires data from another module, it must inject the corresponding Service (e.g., `PatientsService` inside `EncountersService`) rather than accessing the Repository directly.
- **Nx Linting**: We utilize `@nx/enforce-module-boundaries` to enforce dependency graphs. Do not bypass these lint rules.

## 2. Multi-Tenancy (Data Isolation)
- **Schema-per-Tenant**: Every tenant operates in their own Postgres schema (`tenant_<hospitalId>`).
- **Never hardcode schemas**: Do not pass `schema` configurations statically in Entities. The `TenantConnectionService` dynamically applies `SET search_path TO "tenant_XYZ"` to the active Postgres connection.
- **Audit Compliance**: You must never execute queries outside of the `TenantConnectionService.runInTenantSchema()` boundary unless querying globally shared master data. 

## 3. Asynchronous Events & Lifecycle Hooks
To keep the primary business operations fast and resilient, cross-cutting concerns (Audit Logs, Analytics, Search Indexing) must be decoupled from the core transaction.
- **TypeORM Subscribers**: Use `EntitySubscriberInterface` (e.g., `ReportingSubscriber`).
- **Fire-and-Forget**: Publishers must wrap external/secondary database writes in a `try/catch` block. A failure to write an audit log should **never** roll back a life-saving clinical order.
- **Lifecycle Caveats**: Remember that TypeORM `afterInsert` fires before child entities are saved if the parent service performs sequential `.save()` calls instead of using `cascade: true`. Plan your payload extraction accordingly.

## 4. TypeScript & ESM Rules
- **ES Modules**: The project strictly enforces ESM (`"type": "module"` in `package.json`).
- **File Extensions**: All relative imports in `.ts` files MUST include the `.js` extension. Example: `import { Patient } from './patient.entity.js';`
- **Strict Typing**: Ensure `strict: true` is enabled. Avoid `any` types.

## 5. Testing
We enforce a high standard of integration testing against real databases rather than mocking out Repositories.
- **`inTenant()` Helper**: Wrap your integration tests in the `inTenant(TEST_TENANT_ID, async () => { ... })` utility. This automatically provisions a test schema and runs your assertions inside a transacted sandbox that rolls back on completion.
- **Zero-Pollution**: Tests must not leave residual data. Always use the built-in Jest hooks to clean up connections (`app.close()`).
